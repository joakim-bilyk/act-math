abstract: "This document provides a practical example of applications of machine learning algorithms to car insurance data using the `mlr3` package. A popular model used in pricing of non-life insurance policies is the frequency-severity model, where the price is decomposed into the product of the probability of a claim arrises and the expected claim size given a claim occurs. This model is fitted using machine learning algorithms such as penalized linear regression and random forests. This paper argues that the ranger model gives a particular well fit to both the frequency and severity model."

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
