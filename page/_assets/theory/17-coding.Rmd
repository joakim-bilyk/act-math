## R-Packages

### mlr3

This short introduction to the `mlr3` package is based on the official documentation and introduction [book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com) and exercises done in the course Machine Learning in Non-Life Insurance.

We start by installing the package `mlr3verse` containing all of the importatant packages.

```{r,eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mlr3verse")
```

```{r}
library(mlr3)
task_mtcars = tsk("mtcars")
task_mtcars
```
