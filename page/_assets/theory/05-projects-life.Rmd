## Cash flows, Markov models, and policyholder behavior

When we model life-insurance contracts we are faced with a list of choices around how the payments are handled, the behavior of the underlying statewise jump process and the information on which we base our valuation. The most central thing to consider is the payment process $B$ and hence under which events the insurance expect to receive premiums and pay out benefits. We model the payments by the dynamics of $B$ and assume $B(0-)=0$:

$$
dB(t)=\sum_{i\in \mathcal J}1\{Z(t)=i\}\Big(b^{i}(t)\ dt+ \Delta B^i(t)\Big)+\sum_{k,j\in \mathcal J, k\ne j}b^{kj}(t)\ dN^{kj}(t),
$$

where we assume $b^i$, $\Delta B^i$ and $b^{ij}$ are deterministic FV-functions for all $i,j\in  \mathcal J$. This is indeed the most important choice for the insurance contract.

Next, we should assume some jump process for $Z(t)$ that governs the payment process. In general we assume that $Z=(Z(t))_{t\ge 0}$ is a non-explosive pure jump process, that is for any bounded interval $[t,s]$ for $t\ne s$ the counting process, defined as

$$
N(t)=\#\{0\le s\le t : Z(s)\ne Z(s-)\},
$$

does not tend to infinity. Therefore since we assumed that the payment processes $b^i$, $\Delta B^i$ and $b^{ij}$ are FV-functions then it follows that $B$ is a CADLAG process of finite variation (FV). Notice that we did not assume any Markov properties on $Z$.

We could assume some underlying process for $Z$ but we could just as well assume something about the predictable compensators of $B$ and $Z$ that is $\Lambda^B$ and $(\Lambda^{N^{ij}})_{i,j\in E}$. Recall that for all FV-processes $X$ there exist a predictable compensator such that

$$
M^X(t)=X(t)-\Lambda^X(t),
$$

is a Martingale wrt. $\sigma(X(t))$. We determine the predictable compensator through its dynamics

$$
d\Lambda^X(t)=\mathbb E[dX(t)\ \vert\ \sigma(X(t-))].
$$

Lastly, we define the information which is used when modelling the payments and valuating the contract. This is a filtration $\mathcal F=(\mathcal F_t)_{t\ge 0}$ which may be chosen according to the needed information for the payment stream $B$. In the most simple example we would have

$$
\mathcal F_t=\sigma\left(\mathcal F_t^{Z},\mathcal F_t^{r}\right),
$$

where $r$ is the short rate on the investments and $\mathcal F_t^X=\sigma(X(t))$ is the smallest sigma algebra that makes $X$ measurable. In more elaborate models the information could also contain state duration or other information.

### Cash flows

Reserving is an important topic in life insurance as it ensures that the insurance company reserve adequate cash to pay customers in the future. The liabilities at a timepoint $t\ge 0$ is given by the reserve denoted by $V$:

$$
V(t)=\mathbb E^{\mathbb Q\otimes \mathbb P}\left[\left.\int_t^\infty e^{-\int_t^sr(u)\ du}dB(s)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right],
$$

where we use the product measure that valuate outcomes from $B$ that is $Z$ under the objective probability measure $\mathbb P$ and the short rate under the martingale measure $\mathbb Q\sim\mathbb P$. We will furthermore assume that $r$ and $Z$ are independend and that $\mathbb Q\sim\mathbb P$ ensures this. We denote this product measure $\mathbb Q\otimes \mathbb P$ and the superscript indicates that this is used in the integral. If we use the predictable compensator for $B$ we may assume that it is absolutely continuous and so

$$
\Lambda^B(t)=\Lambda^B(0)+\int_0^t\lambda^B(s)\ ds,
$$

hence

$$
V(t)=\mathbb E^{\mathbb Q\otimes \mathbb P}\left[\left.\int_t^\infty e^{-\int_t^sr(u)\ du}\lambda^B(s)\ ds\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]+\mathbb E^{\mathbb Q\otimes \mathbb P}\left[\left.\int_t^\infty e^{-\int_t^sr(u)\ du}d M^B(s)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right],
$$

where of cause the martingale integral is almost surely zero and hence in expectation zero. We can furthermore move the expectation inside using Fubini and obtain.

$$
V(t)=\int_t^\infty E^{\mathbb Q}\left[\left. e^{-\int_t^sr(u)\ du}\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]\mathbb E^{\mathbb P}\left[\left.\lambda^B(s)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]\ ds.
$$

We can now define the forward rate $f_t(s)$ according to

$$
E^{\mathbb Q}\left[\left. e^{-\int_t^sr(u)\ du}\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]=e^{-\int_t^sf_t(u)\ du}.
$$

We also see that this is in fact the pricing function for the zero-coupon bond maturing at time $s\ge t$. We can furthermore define the **expected cash flow** during $[t,s]$ by

$$
A(t,s)=\int_t^s\mathbb E^{\mathbb P}\left[\left.\lambda^B(u)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]\ du.
$$

If we use the notation $A(t,ds)$ as the dynamics of $A(s):=A(t,s)$ we may write

$$
V(t)=\int_t^\infty e^{-\int_t^s f_t(u)\ du} A(t,ds).
$$

If one use this decomposition one can compute the expected cash flow from today until infinity and study independently the effects of changing the rate model and mortality model. Crucially we assumed that $r$ and $Z$ are independent which in the case of policy behavour may not hold (high returns may result in increased free policy intensity).

### Smooth Markov model

In classic life insurance mathematics we assume the following:

  * The functions $(\mu^{ij}(t))_{i,j\in\mathcal J}$ defined as
  $$\mu^{ij}(t)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}p^{ij}(t,t+h)$$
  exists and are differentiable at all timepoints $t\ge 0$.
  * The predictable compensator of $B$ is given by
  \begin{align*}
  d\Big(\Lambda^B(s)\ \vert\ \mathcal F_t\Big)&=d\Big(\Lambda^B(s)\ \vert\ Z(t)\Big)\\
  &=\sum_{i\in \mathcal J}1\{Z(t)=i\}p^{ij}(t,s)\left(b^i(t)\ ds+\Delta B^i(t)+\sum_{j\in\mathcal J, j\ne i}b^{ij}(t)\mu^{ij}(t)\ ds\right).
  \end{align*}
  * The transition probabilities $p^{ij}(t)$ satisfies Kolmogorov's forward differential equation
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial s}p^{ij}(t,s)=\sum_{k\in\mathcal J,k\ne j}p^{ik}(t,s)\mu^{kj}(s)\ ds-p^{ij}(t,s)\sum_{k\in\mathcal J, k\ne j}\mu^{jk}(s)
  \end{align*}
  with boundary condition $p^{ij}(t,t)=\delta^{ij}$ with $\delta^{ij}=1\{i=j\}$.

We call this a smooth model becauce $\mu^{ij}$ are continuous and so $p^{ij}$ are smooth. There does exist models where $\mu^{ij}$ can be non-continuous. In this classic model the expected cash flow is given by
\begin{align*}
A(t,s)&=\mathbb E^\mathbb P\left[\left.B(s)-B(t)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]=\mathbb E^\mathbb P\left[\left.\Lambda^B(s)-\Lambda^B(t)\ \right\vert\  Z(t)\right]\\
&=\int_t^s\sum_{i\in \mathcal J}1\{Z(t)=i\}p^{ij}(t,u)\left(b^i(u)\ du+\Delta B^i(u)+\sum_{j\in\mathcal J, j\ne i}b^{ij}(u)\mu^{ij}(u)\ du\right)
\end{align*}
hence

$$
A(t,ds)=\sum_{i\in \mathcal J}1\{Z(t)=i\}p^{ij}(t,s)\left(b^i(s)\ ds+\Delta B^i(s)+\sum_{j\in\mathcal J, j\ne i}b^{ij}(s)\mu^{ij}(s)\ ds\right).
$$

If we calculate $p^{ij}(t,s)$ for all $i,j\in\mathcal J$ and $s\ge t$ for all $t\ge 0$ we easily obtain the vector functions

$$
\left(A^i(t,s)\right)_{i\in\mathcal J}=\left(\int_t^s p^{ij}(t,s)\left(b^i(s)\ ds+\Delta B^i(s)+\sum_{j\in\mathcal J, j\ne i}b^{ij}(s)\mu^{ij}(s)\ ds\right)\right)_{i\in\mathcal J}
$$

where $t$ is fixed and $s\ge t$. Using this result we can write the reserve as

$$
V(t)=\sum_{i\in \mathcal J}1\{Z(t)=i\}\int_t^\infty e^{-\int_t^s f_t(u)\ du}p^{ij}(t,s)\left(b^i(s)\ ds+\Delta B^i(s)+\sum_{j\in\mathcal J, j\ne i}b^{ij}(s)\mu^{ij}(s)\ ds\right).
$$

### Absorbing sub state space

One can construct models where that include policy behavior. This may include the free policy option, surrender option and/or early retirement option. By this we mean:

  * *The free policy option*; the option to at any point stop paying premiums but still be entitled to some benefits (though lower than expected),
  * *The surrender option*; the option to at any point cancel the contract and receive a compensatory payment,
  * *Early retirement option*; the option to at any point transition into the retirement state and start receiving benefits (though lower than by waiting to the agreed upon retirement date).

In any case, this leads to a subdivision of the statespace $\mathcal J$ into $\mathcal J_0$ and $\mathcal J_1$ such that $\mathcal J_0\cap \mathcal J_1=\emptyset$ and $\mathcal J_0\cup\mathcal J_1=\mathcal J$. We let the policy start in $\mathcal J_0$ i.e. $Z(0)\in\mathcal J_0$ almost surely and assume that $\mathcal J_1$ is absorbing i.e. for all $i\in \mathcal J_1$ and $j\in\mathcal J_0$ we have $p^{ij}(t,s)=0$ for all $t\le s$.

In the free policy option we would simply take a copy of $\mathcal J$ (for instance active, disabled and dead) and say that the policy may jump to a free policy version of $\mathcal J$ at any time but not back. In that case we would simply have

$$
\mathcal J=\{\text{active}(0),\text{disabled}(1),\text{dead}(2)\}\cup\{\text{active as fp}(3),\text{disabled as fp}(4),\text{dead as fp}(5)\},
$$

the so-called six state model. In general, we define the transition time from $\mathcal J_0$ to $\mathcal J_1$ as

$$
\tau =\inf\{t\ge 0 : Z(t)\in\mathcal J_1\}
$$

using the convention $\inf\emptyset =\infty$. As we would need to adjust the payment streams in $\mathcal J_1$ based on the time of transition $\tau$ we define the function $\rho(i,j,t):\mathcal J_0\times \mathcal J_1\times [0,\infty)\to\mathbb R$ typical taking values in $(0,1]$ as a adjustment factor to the payments in the sub statespace $\mathcal J_1$. The factor that is just is determined by the transition $Z(\tau -)\to Z(\tau)$, that is the factor $\rho(Z(\tau-),Z(\tau),\tau)$. In this case we define the payment stream as

$$
dB(t)=dB_0(t)+dB_1(t),
$$

with

$$
dB_0(t)=\sum_{i\in \mathcal J_0}1\{Z(t)=i\}\Big(b^{i}(t)\ dt+ \Delta B^i(t)\Big)+\sum_{k,j\in \mathcal J_0, k\ne j}b^{kj}(t)\ dN^{kj}(t)
$$

and

$$
dB_1(t)=\rho(Z(\tau-),Z(\tau),\tau)\left(\sum_{i\in \mathcal J_1}1\{Z(t)=i\}\Big(b^{i}(t)\ dt+ \Delta B^i(t)\Big)+\sum_{k,j\in \mathcal J_1, k\ne j}b^{kj}(t)\ dN^{kj}(t)\right).
$$

Notice that no payments are payed upon the transition $Z(\tau-)\to Z(\tau)$. Then we have the expected cash flow given by
\begin{align*}
A(t,s)&=\mathbb E^\mathbb P\left[\left.B(s)-B(t)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]=\mathbb E^\mathbb P\left[\left.\int_t^s dB_0(u)+ \int_t^s dB_1(u)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]\\
&=\mathbb E^\mathbb P\left[\left.\int_t^s \sum_{i\in \mathcal J_0}1\{Z(u)=i\}\Big(b^{i}(u)\ du+ \Delta B^i(u)\Big)+\sum_{k,j\in \mathcal J_0, k\ne j}b^{kj}(u)\ dN^{kj}(u)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]\\
&+\mathbb E^\mathbb P\left[\rho(Z(\tau-),Z(\tau),\tau)\int_t^s \sum_{i\in \mathcal J_1}1\{Z(u)=i\}\Big(b^{i}(u)\ du+ \Delta B^i(u)\Big)\right.\\
&+\left.\left.\sum_{k,j\in \mathcal J_1, k\ne j}b^{kj}(u)\ dN^{kj}(u)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\right]\\
&=\sum_{i\in \mathcal J_0}1\{Z(t)=i\}\int_t^s \sum_{j\in\mathcal J_0,j\ne i}p^{ij}(t,u)\left(\Big(b^{j}(u)\ du+ \Delta B^j(u)\Big)+\sum_{k\in \mathcal J_0, k\ne j}b^{jk}(u)\mu^{jk}(u)\ du \right)\\
&+\sum_{i\in \mathcal J}\sum_{j\in \mathcal J_1}\int_t^s\mathbb E^\mathbb P\Big[\left.1\{Z(t)=i\} 1\{Z(u)=j\}\rho(Z(\tau-),Z(\tau),\tau)\ \right\vert\ \mathcal F_t\Big]\\
&\left(\Big(b^{j}(u)\ du+ \Delta B^j(u)\Big)+\sum_{k\in \mathcal J_0, k\ne j}b^{jk}(u)\mu^{jk}(u)\ du \right),
\end{align*}
where the integral $\int_t^s dB_0(t)$ only sums over the starting states in $\mathcal J_0$ since one only receive payments in $\mathcal J_0$ at time $u\ge t$ if one starts in this subspace. If we define

$$
p_\rho^{ij}(t,s)=E^\mathbb P\Big[\left.1\{Z(s)=j\}\rho(Z(\tau-),Z(\tau),\tau)^{1\{Z(s)\in \mathcal J_1\}}\ \right\vert\ Z(t)=i\Big]
$$

then the above simplifies to

$$
A(t,ds)=p_\rho^{ij}(t,u)\left(\Big(b^{j}(u)\ du+ \Delta B^j(u)\Big)+\sum_{k\in \mathcal J_0, k\ne j}b^{jk}(u)\mu^{jk}(u)\ du \right).
$$


And so we may evaluate the reserves if we can compute $(p_\rho^{ij}(t,s))_{i,j\in\mathcal J}$.

### $\rho$-modified Kolmogorov

As we saw in the above section solving the cash flow in the policy behaviour model comes down to solving the quantities

$$
p_\rho^{ij}(t,s)=E^\mathbb P\Big[\left.1\{Z(s)=j\}\rho(Z(\tau-),Z(\tau),\tau)^{1\{Z(s)\in \mathcal J_1\}}\ \right\vert\ Z(t)=i\Big]\tag{1}
$$

we will henceforth call the $\rho$-modified transition probabilities. It follows that even though this expectations seems problematic due to the stopping time $\tau$. However, one can show that the $\rho$-modified transition probabilities follows a forward kolmogorov differential equation:

<blockquote class = "prop">

**Proposition 1. ($\rho$-modified Kolmogorov)**\index{$\rho$-modified Kolmogorov} _Let the $\rho$-modified transition probabilities be given by (1). For $i,j\in\mathcal J$ we have_

$$
\frac{d}{ds}p_\rho^{ij}(t,s)=\sum_{k\in\mathcal J,k\ne j}p_\rho^{ik}(t,s)\mu^{kj}(s)\rho(k,j,s)^{1_{\{k\in \mathcal J_1\}}}-p_\rho^{ij}(t,s)\sum_{k\in \mathcal J,k\ne j}\mu^{jk}(s),
$$

_with boundary condition $p_\rho^{ij}(t,t)=1$._

</blockquote>

Notice that $p_\rho^{ij}(t,s)=0$ and $\mu^{ij}(t)=0$ for all $t\le s$ with $i\in\mathcal J_1$ and $j\in\mathcal J_0$, hence the above may be simplified for some transitions.
